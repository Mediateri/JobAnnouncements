# Overview

Here in Rwanda getting job of your profession is not that easy because of how information is being given. And the employers have problems of hiring people who donâ€™t know what to do. Sometime a job announcement may take more than two months on job announcement website not because of there is no one to apply for it just because of those have managed to apply for it  are not qualified for the job yet those who are qualified for job have problems not getting announcements. That is the reason why here in Rwanda it looks like that there is shortage of employees on job market. And the problem really is communication that is the reason why this system is needed to act as mediator between employees and employers.
